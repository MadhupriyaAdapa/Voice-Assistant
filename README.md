Jarvis is a smart voice-controlled assistant developed using Python that mimics the functionality of a personal AI helper. It interacts with the user through natural voice commands and performs a wide variety of tasks in real-time. Inspired by the fictional AI from Iron Man, Jarvis is designed to assist users by automating everyday tasks and providing quick access to system features and web resources.
Jarvis listens to your voice commands, processes them using speech recognition and natural language processing, and responds through voice output using text-to-speech. It integrates several Python libraries to make the assistant interactive, functional, and extendable.
🚀 How It Works:
The assistant activates on a trigger (like "Hey Jarvis").

It listens for the user’s voice command through a microphone.

The audio input is processed and converted to text.

Based on the command, it performs the relevant action (speak the time, search something, open an app, etc.).

It provides voice feedback using a speech engine.
